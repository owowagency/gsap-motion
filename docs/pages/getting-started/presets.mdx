# Presets

Presets are pre-configured animations that you can easily drop into your projects to create beautiful effects with minimal effort. They are designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing you to adjust parameters to suit your specific needs. Our library currently features the following presets:

## Presets

- **Diorama**: The `createDiorama()` preset provides a unique 3D scrolling effect, creating a sense of depth and immersion. It's perfect for creating parallax scrolling websites or adding a touch of interactivity to your web pages.

- **Marquee**: The `createMarquee()` preset allows you to create classic marquee animations. This preset is great for creating scrolling text or image sliders.

- **Parallax**: The `createParallax()` preset enables you to create parallax scrolling effects. This effect can add a sense of depth to your web pages, making them more engaging and visually interesting.

- **Text Clip Reveal**: The `createTextClipReveal()` preset is designed for revealing text in a creative way. It's perfect for titles, headers, or any text that you want to stand out.

## Motion

Each preset implements the `createMotion()` utility, which comes with a `destroy` function, allowing you to manually stop and clean up the effect when it's no longer needed. This ensures optimal performance and resource management in your projects.
