# Introduction

Welcome to **@owowagency/gsap-motion**! A web animation library, based on GSAP.

Motion and animations are amazing! But they can be complex to manage.

We have to deal with a myriad of different devices, changing layouts, resource management -- all while keep things running buttery smooth.

This library is a comprehensive toolkit for creating and _managing_ animations with ease. It features a variety of animation utilities, as well as preset drop-in animation functions, allowing you to effortlessly create a wide range of effects.

The library is framework agnostic, meaning it can be seamlessly integrated into any project that already includes GSAP.
