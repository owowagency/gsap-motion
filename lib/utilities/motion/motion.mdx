The Motion class is a versatile and lightweight wrapper designed to simplify animation management and address common challenges in responsive design and window/element resizing. It serves as a foundation for building various types of animations by providing the following key features.

## Motion Creator

The Motion class constructor requires a motion creator, which simplifies the creation of animations by providing a convenient GSAP context. This creator function is leveraged to define animations and optionally return a cleanup function for tasks like removing event listeners or reverting animations, enhancing code encapsulation and maintenance.

Basic example of a Motion instance with some cleanup logic.

```js
import { Motion } from "@owowagency/gsap-motion";

const myMotion = new Motion(() => {
  // create a simple tween
  const tween = gsap.to("div", { background: "#ff0000" });

  // return a cleanup function...
  // when `myMotion` is destroyed, revert the tween
  return () => {
    tween.revert();
  };
});
```

### Meta object

Each instance of the Motion class contains a meta object that serves as a storage space for developers to conveniently store any relevant motion-related data. This allows for easy access and encapsulation of motion-specific information within the respective motion instance.

```js
const myMotion = new Motion((self) => {
  // create some 3D object
  const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
  const material = new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial();

  // store the mesh in the Motion's meta data
  self.meta.mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);

  const rotate = gsap.ticker.add(() => {
    self.meta.mesh.rotation.y += 0.01;
  });

  return () => {
    gsap.ticker.remove(rotate);
  };
});

// somewhere else in your code base

scene.add(myMotion.meta.mesh);
```

### GSAP Context

The Motion creator function provides a convenient [GSAP context](<https://greensock.com/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.context()>) object.

```js
const myMotion = new Motion((_, context) => {
  context.add(() => {
    gsap.to(".foo", { color: "#000ff" });
  });

  context.add(() => {
    gsap.to(".bar", { color: "#00ff00" });
  });

  return () => {
    // revert all tweens at once
    context.revert();
  };
});
```

## Responsive design support

The Motion class offers a utility to handle responsive design using CSS media queries. It determines if specific animations or motion should be created or omitted based on customizable media query conditions.

```js
import { Motion } from "@owowagency/gsap-motion";

// create a motion instance that is only applied on landscape oriented screens,
// with a width of 768px or bigger

const myMotion = new Motion(
  () => {
    gsap.to(".fade-in", {
      opacity: 1,
    });
  },
  {
    watchMedia: "(min-width: 768px) and (orientation: landscape)",
  }
);
```

## Window & Element resizing

The Motion class provides utilities to handle resizing events and offers flexible options to control resizing behavior on vertical, horizontal, or both axes. This enables the creation of animations that adapt to changes in screen or element dimensions.

```js
// reset when the body resizes
const myMotion = new Motion(() => ..., { shouldResetOnResize: document.body });
```

```js
// reset when the body's horizontal axis resizes
const myMotion = new Motion(() => ..., { shouldResetOnResize: [document.body, 'horizontal'] });
```

```js
// reset when the `myElement`'s vertical axis resizes
const myElement = document.querySelector(".will-resize");
const myMotion = new Motion(() => ..., { shouldResetOnResize: [myElement, 'vertical'] });
```

## Subscriptions

Motion instances support the concept of subscriptions through the use of [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/). The subscriptions property enables developers to manage and store subscriptions associated with the motion instance. These subscriptions are automatically cleaned up when the motion instance is destroyed, ensuring efficient resource management.

```js
import { fromEvent } from "rxjs";
import { Motion } from "@owowagency/gsap-motion";

const myMotion = new Motion((self) => {
  const button = document.querySelector("button");
  const sub = fromEvent("mouseenter", button).subscribe(() => {
    gsap.to(button, { opacity: 1 });
  });

  self.subscriptions.push(sub);
});
```

## Reset and Destroy

The Motion class provides two essential methods: `reset()` and `destroy()`. The `reset()` method runs the cleanup function and restores the instance to its desired initial state. On the other hand, the `destroy()` method runs the cleanup function, then clears all members, making them eligible for garbage collection. These methods facilitate efficient memory management and allow for seamless cleanup of motion instances.

```js
const myMotion = new Motion(() => ..., { ... });

myMotion.reset(); // reset to initial state
myMotion.destroy(); // destroy and cleanup any and all members
```

## Additional notes on constructor parameters

Any motion param can be a method that returns that specific param value:

```js
new Motion(() => ..., {
  watchMedia: () => "(min-width: 786px)",
})

new Motion(() => ..., {
  watchMedia: "(min-width: 786px)",
})
```

This concept applies to all parameters.
