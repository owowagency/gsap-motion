<Title />

Second Order Dynamics in procedural motion and animation refers to a mathematical model that simulates object behavior by considering forces, acceleration, velocity, and position. It enables realistic animations by accurately representing movement and forces acting on objects.
It can be utilized to create interesting, convincing real-time motion on a frame to frame basis.

More documentation coming soon (tm). Meanwhile check the attached code pen for workings and inspiration.

```js
let initialX = 0;
let targetX = 10;
const dynamics = new SecondOrderDynamics2(1, 0.5, -1, 0);

gsap.ticker.add((_, deltaTime) => {
  const newX = dynamics.update(deltaTime / 1000, targetX);
  // do something with x
});
```
