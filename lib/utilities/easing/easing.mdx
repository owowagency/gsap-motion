The Ease class is a collection of static methods that provide a set of easing functions to enhance animation control and create smooth and natural motion. These easing functions can be leveraged to achieve smooth transitions, precise timing, and create dynamic and engaging procedural motion effects.

```js
gsap.ticker.add((time) => {
  const progress = gsap.utils.wrapYoyo(0, 1, time);
  const opacity = Ease.inOutSine(progress);
  gsap.set("div", { opacity });
});
```

See [easings.net](https://easings.net/) for visualisations of featured easing functions.

All easing functions require a single float time `t` which indicates time from `0` to `1`. `back` and `elastic` easings also allow a second option `m` magnitude.
